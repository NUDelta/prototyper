## What is RPPT?
Remote Paper Prototype Testing, or RPPT, is a [DTR](http://dtr.meteor.com) project from [Delta Lab](https://delta.northwestern.edu) that takes a new approach to lo-fidelity prototype evaluation. Traditional advances in prototyping or design methods lean toward quickly developing more complex and fleshed out demos, which often means creating many predefined interactions for designers to customize and insert. RPPT instead focuses on making low fidelity paper prototyping, which has no such restrictions, more accessible, powerful, and able to be conducted remotely. For further information, take a look at [our CHI publication.](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2702423)
